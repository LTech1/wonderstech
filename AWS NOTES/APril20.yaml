AWS 
......................................
AWS along side EKS 
computer:

	hardware
	os
	databases
	applications 
servers are super computer 
we need a database ( volume)
EBS =  elastic block store . 
databses are installed . 
in the past companies host thier own data centres 
it can always be a problem to self manage on prem infrastructure. 
infrastructure management  can be very complicated . 
datacebtre 

Cloud Engineers:
infrastructure engineer:
	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  Create a Highly Available Infrstructre 
  Maintaining infrastrue on prem is such a high cost. 
  High Availability ensures that we can access our applications at any time 

  ...............................
  Fault tolerance 
  Back up and restore 
  Set up scalable Infrstructre
Cloud Engineer:
  AWS certfied engineer and not still hired.
  ..........................
  provision : 
    configured and manage computers
Resources  provisioned when we use kops: 
  ebs, s3, elb,vps, networking. 
  IAAS: client managed part of the infrastructure
  ec2 = infrastructure. 
  PAAS: client managed the applications and data. example is EKS, ECS,   
  saas: Everything is managed by the cloud provider. example : gitub, lambda, sonatype nexus, 
  Availability zones are isolated from each other.  
  Engineered
when u used eks: you can have a vpc, that can come with fouir 4 subnets.
An AZ is a collection of one or more datacentres in an AZ
High Availabity :
  place resources in different AZ
  And multi region concept. 
  and levraging resources in aws cloud
  EOSCALE:
    How to choose the right region:
      How have you been invlved in decision making. 
      price : which region is cheaper
      service Availabity: 
        customers location:
          customer locations:
            Latency:
              security and compliance and Requirements:
    we can place our resources in areas where there is polical instability:

      EC2  BASICS : 
         elastic compute cloud. 
         scalable computing capacity in the aws cloud. 
         ....................
         Security Groups. 
         Elastic block starage : 
          awsc is selling computing services.
          ON demand options : create and terminate the instances at anytime 
          Reserve Instances : purchase an instaces for a reserved period:
           spot instances: 
              servers that no one is using. 
            ...............
            AMI:
              GolDEN  AMI:
  After the Break:
AMI:
  Community versions ( includes most of the free tiears)
  Marketplace 
  My  IAM.  we can create our own image 
  free tier only.

Go to EC2 SERVICES : 
  EBS VOLUMES : 

Market place : 
  splung is a substitute for elstics search , filbeat and kibana
  IT Business management Applications

Instance type : 
  computer power

Community Edition : 
     Amazon linux2:
Kind of Servers: 
   would depend on applications and expectations  of work load.
   Security acts as a virutal firewall that deptermines how traffic flows in and out of our instances 
   Instaces comes with Private Ip addresses for communications with the VPC 
   Elastic/static public IP address: 

    connecting to an Instance: 
      Host details
      Git bash 
      putty
      ssh private key.pem/password. 
      username : once u log in, you can add more users and assign password 
      ubuntu: 
Stoarage  class:
  EBS = Elastic block store : root volume for our ecs instances. 
  object storages.  
    S3: SOTRAGES FOR ALL MOVIES.

    Block starage needs to be formatted. 
  16 TB of data. 
  we can snatpshot ebs while it is running 
  EBS  can only be backed at a particular Availabity zones:
    s3 buckets can run independently of s3 buckets. 
    the root volume of servers is ebs volumes : 
 eba synapshot can be taken and attached to an exiting server
 
 ..........................
 EBS GENERAL PURPOSES : 
  it comes with reliabilty and flexibilty:
     s3:  simple storage services
  when servers are installed it comes with a piece of storage
  command
  df /h
  lsblk

  jum server: 
    How do you ensure that only 
    dont open traffic from everywhere 
    open traffic from a specific source. 

    in our group : 
      promethues handles more of metrics 
      elastic stack - logs/ log management and data analytic

kubectl edit svc promethues-server -n monitoring.
...........................
use promethues as the datasource:
