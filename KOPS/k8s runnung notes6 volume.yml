node exposters gather data together for promethuesto collect it for further processing

kubestate metrics.
data collection to avoid problems that could occur. 
promethuesto got a web server 
promethues also have a time series databases 
 promethues needs a peace of storage within the cluster. 
  so data can persist. 

........................................
Elastic search, logstach and  Kebana
helm is a package manager for kubernates:
  we can use helm to manage thirdparty application. 
  ELF STACK 
  ........................
  devops enginer are incharge of production. 
  helm configure production grate monitoring tools 
  monitoring is very important. 

  application and system logs:
    helps us understand what is happening within our cluster. 
    logs are used to debung and monitoring cluster service. 
    .................................
    managing complex 
  microservice monitoring can be very complex. 

  Elastic stack can be used along with docker. 
  Elastic stack is an open source application. 
  search analyse and visualize the data in real time. 

  Elastic search is used to analyse data .  the data comes in a jason format. 

  kebana is designed to work with elastic search. 
  kebana is used to visualize and analyse data stored in elastic search. 
  beats: beats are generally data shippers. 
  beats is a software that would collect and ship data. 
  we would install beat in our k8s cluster. 

  file 
  metricbeat:
  packagebeat:
  heartbeat: is used to monitor the up time performance for our application, server, pod. 
  we would focus on filebeat:
    elastic search also does processing. 
Filebeat : collects data and ship it to logstash.
all the nodes in the cluster would generate data. 
logs would be generated from pods
